# MPyC-Survey

This code is an implementation of a survey using the MPyC library. It allows for multiple parties to input answers to a set of questions securely and privately, and then calculates the mean and mode of the answers.

Requirements:
 -Python 3.7 or above
 -MPyC (pip install mpyc)
 -collections (pip install collections)
 
Usage:
 -Run the code using python survey.py
 -Input the number of players participating in the survey
 -Each player will be prompted to answer the set of questions, with a list of choices to select from
 -The program will output the mean and mode of the answers
 
Customization:
 -The set of questions and choices can be edited in the questions list at the beginning of the code
 -The security parameter (secFlt) can be adjusted as needed
 
 
Note: This is a basic implementation of a survey using MPyC and may need further customization for specific use cases.
